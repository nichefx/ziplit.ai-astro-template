For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports .astro syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React components, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.

CRITICAL RULE: We use Tailwind v4, so DO NOT ADD STYLES to tailwind.config.mjs, ALWAYS use the global.css file!

CRITICAL RULE: NEVER WRITE `package.json` directly use npm comands to install packages if needed 

CRITICAL RULE: Whenever using `npm install package`, ALWAYS include `-y`

CRITICAL RULE: motion library does not have export named `timeline`, it only has animate, stagger, inView.

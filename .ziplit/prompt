For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports .astro syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.


CRITICAL RULE: NEVER WRITE `package.json` directly use npm comands to install packages if needed 

You can always add shadcn/ui components by running `npx shadcn@latest add component_name -y`

CRITICAL RULE: Whenever using `npm install package` or `npx shadcn@latest add component_name`, ALWAYS include `-y`
